## 👨‍🎓 About Me

AI-EDA • Hardware–AI Co-Design • Intelligent Verification • Edge AI Systems
Graduate Engineer working at the intersection of machine learning, hardware design, and embedded intelligence.
I build learning-assisted verification flows, accelerator architectures, adaptive embedded platforms, and exploratory system tools that bridge the gap between algorithms and circuits.

My goal is to help create next-generation EDA systems that learn from hardware behavior and automatically optimize design, timing, and verification.

# 🔬 ResearchAnil Rongala Interests

I’m deeply interested in the role of learning-based approaches in modern hardware design and verification.
My current work and long-term vision align with:

## AI for EDA & Verification Automation
• Intelligent test generation
• Coverage-driven learning
• Behavioral modeling and timing prediction
• Automated stimulus synthesis
• Data-driven IP verification frameworks

## Hardware–AI Co-Design
• Neural accelerator microarchitectures
• Systolic arrays, PE designs, memory tiling
• HW-SW co-optimization for ML workloads
• Architecture behavior modeling

## Edge AI & Embedded Intelligence
• MCU-level AI inference
• Sensor fusion & IMU pipelines
• Real-time embedded systems
• RTOS-based control (TI-RTOS, FreeRTOS)

## Systems & Exploration
• Memory behavior modeling
• Multi-threaded computation
• Design space exploration
• Small-scale robotics and autonomous sensing

I enjoy research that combines theoretical modeling with practical hardware/software implementation, especially when it improves design automation.
