### 👨‍🎓 About Me

I am a **Digital Verification Engineer and Researcher** working at the intersection of **Scalable Validation**, **FPGA Prototyping**, and **Hardware Assurance**.

As semiconductor complexity scales, "functional correctness" is no longer enough—we need **Assurance**. My work bridges the gap between standard industry verification (SystemVerilog/UVM) and emerging research in **Hardware Trust, Real-Time FPGA Prototyping, and Reliability**.

I combine the discipline of a Verification Engineer (architecting rigorous UVM testbenches) with the curiosity of a Researcher (investigating how hardware fails via physical noise, logic bugs, or security vulnerabilities).

### 🔬 Research & Technical Focus

I am deeply interested in bridging the gap between theoretical models and physical hardware behavior:

* **Hardware Assurance & Trust:** Adapting verification flows to detect logic vulnerabilities, architectural anomalies, and reliability failures.
* **FPGA Prototyping:** Validating theoretical models against real-time physical behavior (latency, noise, and jitter) using Xilinx/Intel platforms.
* **Intelligent Verification:** Using data-driven methods (AI/ML) to predict verification hotspots and automate coverage closure.
* **Real-Time Embedded Systems:** Designing deterministic control systems with strict timing constraints (RTOS-based).
